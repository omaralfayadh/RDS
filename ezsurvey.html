             <h2>EZSurvey™ - Desktop Serviceability Tools</h2>
             </div>
             <div>
                     <p> Rainbow Design Services, Inc. has been providing a multitude of services to the Cable/MSO, Utility, Telco and generally to anyone building and maintaining communications infrastructure for many years.  Rainbow specializes in Engineering and Documentation of these networks – and in doing so has provided a “Serviceability Field Survey” service for many years as well.  NOW we can provide a DESKTOP Survey tool integrated with your environment:  EZSurvey™
                     </p>
                     <p>One of the key questions, and ultimately a key differentiator for our best customers, is the speed and accuracy for which the serviceability questions can be answered:  Ex.  “Can I get service at this address?”, “Are your services available where we are building a house?”, “My business wants high-speed internet services from you – how quickly can you provide a connection and what will it cost?”, “We have many cell towers, we want an estimate from you for Backhaul services, how soon can you provide an estimate?”
                     </p>
                     <p>These are just a few examples of the kinds of questions our Service provider customers get asked – questions from Residential customers and even more critically from Commercial customers.  The key is a quick answer, an accurate answer, and real life LIVE metrics to work from.  How do you answer these questions now?  Probably from many data sources, many tools, most likely taking lots of time and probably costing $$ too!
                     </p>
                     <p>A new answer:  Leveraging our years of experience, GIS knowledge, API and Data model knowledge and our embedded Application Development team – we have announced our newest product in the EZMap family – EZSurvey™.  EZSurvey™ is a product that derives its Geo-coding capabilities from the Google Maps API, makes use of all the well-known Google tools (Satellite imagery, addressing data, Lat-Lon information and much more) and even more critically leverages your Engineering data from Engineering/GIS tools like Bentley Comms V8, V8i, SPATIALinfo – Spatialnet among others…   Together these capabilities allow a user to:</p>
                     
                     <ul class="ezbom">
                       <li>Enter an address or Lat/Lon</li>
                       <li>Geocode that address or point</li>
                       <li>Validate visually if the geocoded location appears correct</li>
                       <li>Get a straight-line measurement from that point to nearest facilities (Tap, Ped, Cabinet etc)</li>
                       <li>Get a road-based distance between the same points</li>
                       <li>See entire Strand/Design/RF/Fiber Node projected over the street map</li>
                       <li>Get other details like Map#, Node Name, MS Links and any other important identifiers stored in your Engineering database.</li>

                     <p>Our goal with EZ B.O.M.™ is to provide our customers with an INSTANT answer to the reporting needs around their Engineering and Plant data.  No more is it acceptable to rely on the software vendors to provide reporting tools and interfaces, they just haven’t had the time to focus on metrics while building Engineering environments – but we have.
                     </p>
                     <p>EZ B.O.M.™ is 100% web-based and cross-browser functional means that these reports can be accessed from anywhere, and with any device (even mobile).  We’ve tested with I-PHONES and IPADs too, this reporting engine works with those devices and means that even when you are in that important meeting and are asked that question that historically it might have taken hours or days to provide --- you can get instant details in a few moments right there in that meeting!! 
                     </p>
                     <p>The data EZ B.O.M.™  provides is LIVE too, as live as your Engineering Server is.  The data is driven directly by connection to Oracle, so even that extension and new design done yesterday or as recent as this morning – if it was posted to Oracle – the metrics are in your report!
                     </p>
                     <p>EZ B.O.M.™ caches your reports too – so over time you can see progressive changes, trends, and use the reports to do time-based analysis.  Run the reports regularly or on a schedule and you’ll have great snapshots like never before into what’s truly transpiring with your Engineering data and where time/effort/money is being spent.
                     </p>
                     <p>Are you storing  COST metrics in your Engineering database?  Many of our customers haven’t taken full advantage of those cost fields in the Equipment profiles – perhaps it’s because the reporting interface wasn’t strong enough to justify entering that data.  Maybe now is the time?  
                     </p>

            <p>This application is totally web-based and is driven by engineering data stored in Oracle, is integrated with Engineering Applications like Bentley Comms and SPATIALnet, and can be extended to other environments (data sources) as well.  The software is cross-browser compliant and tested on Internet Explorer 8, Safari, Mozilla and Firefox.  We have demonstrated use of these applications on I-PHONE, IPAD and other handheld devices – this is a REALLY cool way to use these tools, and makes them super-easy and accessible.</p>
